                Japan is one of the oldest civilizations and has a beautiful and
                diverse history. The stunning, diverse scenery with mountains
                and breathtaking views, which are much appreciated by the
                Japanese, offers so many different experiences that attract
                tourists from all corners of the world. <br />
                <br />
                There are around 100,000 Shinto shrines and 80,000 Buddhist
                temples throughout Japan where locals visit and pray. They are
                some of the most peaceful locations you're likely to find. The
                picture on the left shows one of the many torii gates at the
                famous Fushimi Inari shrine located in the city of Kyoto.
